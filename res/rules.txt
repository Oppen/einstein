The goal of the game is to open all cards in a square of 6x6 cards.  When
every card is open, field looks like this:

$opensquare.bmp$

Every row of the square contains cards of one type only.  For example,
first row contains arabic digits, second - letters, third - rome digits,
fourth - dices, fifth - geometric figures, sixs - mathematic symbols.

Use logic and open cards with method of exclusion.  If a card isn't
open, the cell contains every possible card.  For example,

$closed.bmp$

means that this cell may contain every Roman digit with the exception of
III (because card with III image is absent).  To open a card click on
small image with left mouse button.  To exclude card click with right
mouse button.

Use tips to solve this puzzle.  There are two types of tips:
horizontal and vertical.  Vertical tips are located at bottom of the screen.
For example, vertical tip

$verthint.bmp$

means that letter 'B' and '+' sign are located in the same column.

Horizontal tips are located at the right side of the puzzle square.
There are a few types of horizontal tips.  First type of horizontal
tip says that two cards are located at neighbouring columns, but it is
unknown, which one is at the right side and which one is at the left:

Second tip type means that one card is at the left of another.
It says nothing about distance between those cards.  They may be
in neighbouring columns or at the opposite sides of the puzzle field:

$horposhint.bmp$

The last type of tip means that one card is located between
two other cards:

$horbetweenhint.bmp$

All three cards must be located in neighbour columns, central
card is always between the other two, but it is unknown, which card is located
at the right side and which at the left.

If you no longer need some tip, remove it by right mouse button click.
You can always see removed tips by pressing the 'Switch' button.
